## SVM
Q71. Explain linear SVM classification.

Q72. What is large margin classification?

Q73. What is a support vector?

Q74. Are SVMs sensitive to scale of data?

Q75. What is hard margin classification? What is it's drawback?

Q76. What is soft margin classification?

Q77. What is a kernel in SVM?

Q78. How can we perform classification using SVC on huge datasets or streaming datasets?

Q79. Explain non-linear SVM classification.

Q80. What is polymonial kernel and how can we use it for non-linear SVM classification?

Q81. Is there any limitation of polymonial kernel?

Q82. What is kernel trick?

Q83. How can we use similarity features to tackle nonliner problem?

Q84. What is Gaussian RBF kernel?

Q85. Can we use SVMs for regression? If yes, explain how.

Q86. How SVM uses decision function to make predictions?

Q87. What is Dual Problem?

Q88. Explain Kernelized SVM.

Q89. What are online SVMs?

Q90. Why is it important to scale the inputs when using SVMs?

Q91. Can an SVM classifier output a confidence score when it classifies an instance?

Q92. Should you use the primal or the dual form of the SVM problem to train a model
on a training set with millions of instances and hundreds of features?

Q93. Say you’ve trained an SVM classifier with an RBF kernel, but it seems to underfit
the training set. Should you increase or decrease γ (gamma)? What about C?

Q94. How should you set the QP parameters (H, f, A, and b) to solve the soft margin
linear SVM classifier problem using an off-the-shelf QP solver?

Q95. Train a LinearSVC on a linearly separable dataset. Then train an SVC and a
SGDClassifier on the [iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris). See if you can get them to produce roughly the same model.

Q96. Train an SVM classifier on the MNIST dataset. Since SVM classifiers are binary
classifiers, you will need to use one-versus-the-rest to classify all 10 digits. You
may want to tune the hyperparameters using small validation sets to speed up the
process. What accuracy can you reach?

Q97. Train an SVM regressor on the [housing dataset](https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~ltorgo/Regression/cal_housing.html).
